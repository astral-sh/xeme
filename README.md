A streaming XML parser written in Rust, with an Expat-compatible C API.

## Highlights

- Parse XML incrementally, with namespaces, encodings, entities, and DTD attribute defaults.
- Check XML and inspect parser events from the command line.
- Embed the safe Rust parser or use the Expat-compatible C interface.

Xeme passes the six [CPython 3.12.13 XML test suites](docs/evidence/2026-09-13-cpython-grouping.md)
with both shared and static libraries. See [compatibility](docs/compatibility.md) for
known differences from Expat and the XML specification.

## Installation

Build from this checkout with Rust 1.96 or later:

```console
cargo install --path crates/xeme_cli --bin xeme --locked
```

See the [command-line guide](docs/usage.md) for allocator options, input handling,
and resource limits.

## Getting started

Given `message.xml`:

```xml
<message>Hello &amp; goodbye</message>
```

Check the document:

```console
xeme message.xml
```

Invalid XML exits with a nonzero status. Omit the filename or pass `-` to read
standard input. Xeme can also print parser events and expand namespaces:

```console
xeme --events message.xml
xeme --events --namespaces --chunk-size 4096 message.xml
```

See the [command-line guide](docs/usage.md), the [Rust library guide](docs/library.md),
or the [Expat interface](crates/xeme_expat/) for embedding and callback contracts.
The parser performs no filesystem or network I/O; applications supply input and
resolve external entities. The CLI does not fetch external resources.

See [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development and acceptance criteria, and the
[review guide](docs/review.md) for implementation and test entry points.
